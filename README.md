## Earthquake Visualization Project
This project automatically retrieves data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) on earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher that occurred in the last 30 days. The data is visualized using Plotly Express, creating an interactive map that shows the location and magnitude of each earthquake.

# Features
- Automated Data Retrieval: The script fetches the latest earthquake data from USGS's GeoJSON feed.
- Data Visualization: Earthquake data is plotted on a world map using Plotly Express, with each point colored based on the earthquake's magnitude.

# Future Enhancements
- Automate the script and send notification when the largest earthquakes are reported.
